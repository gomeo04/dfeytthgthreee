Captain Jos Buttler and Phil Salt took the tourists to 77-0 at the end of the powerplay and that became 112-2 at the halfway stage before England collapsed in the second half of the innings to be bowled out for 171.

Andre Russell, making his first West Indies appearance since November 2021, was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3-19, while Romario Shepherd also impressed with figures of 2-22.

The Windies also made a flying start to their innings before being pegged back, with England leg-spinner Adil Rashid taking his 100th T20 international wicket in his 100th match.

After a brief delay for rain, Rehan Ahmed ramped up the pressure on the hosts with two wickets in two balls, only for West Indies to hit back again through the experienced pair of captain Rovman Powell and Russell.
