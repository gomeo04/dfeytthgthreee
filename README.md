Captain Jos Buttler and Phil Salt took the tourists to 77-0 at the end of the powerplay and that became 112-2 at the halfway stage before England collapsed in the second half of the innings to be bowled out for 171.

Andre Russell, making his first West Indies appearance since November 2021, was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3-19, while Romario Shepherd also impressed with figures of 2-22.

The Windies also made a flying start to their innings before being pegged back, with England leg-spinner Adil Rashid taking his 100th T20 international wicket in his 100th match.

After a brief delay for rain, Rehan Ahmed ramped up the pressure on the hosts with two wickets in two balls, only for West Indies to hit back again through the experienced pair of captain Rovman Powell and Russell.

European eyes are watching this election closely, after 13 years of governments under Mark Rutte. The winner could end up with less than 20% of the national vote and fewer than 30 seats in the 150-seat parliament, unprecedented in Dutch politics.

Paul Heckingbottom is set to be sacked as Sheffield United manager within the next 24 hours.



Appointed permanent manager in November 2021, Heckingbottom guided United to the top flight with a second-place Championship finish last season.


Following defeat at Burnley, Heckingbottom criticised the club for making "financial rather than football decisions" by selling key players in the summer following promotion.

The 46-year-old said United were "let down" by some of his players at Burnley, who had never won a Premier League game by five goals. Victory lifted them off the bottom of the table at United's expense.

United are four points from safety, have won only once this season and have a goal difference of minus 28.

They host second-placed Liverpool at Bramall Lane on Wednesday.
