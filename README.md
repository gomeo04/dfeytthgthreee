Chaudhary, 50, has been at the tunnel site for the past 11 days. He is staying with men who know his son and is sleeping in barracks made for the labourers.

Two years ago, he lost his eldest son in a construction accident in Mumbai. He says he cannot face the grief of losing another son.

"I pray to God... please don't take this son away from me. All I want is that my son should be out. This is my prayer. This is my last wish."

A landslide near Silkyara, a remote village at the foothills of the Himalayas, collapsed a portion of the tunnel two weeks ago, trapping the workers. The rescue has been delayed by a drilling machine breaking down.

Chaudhary, who goes by only one name, is one of several family members who have travelled here.

Chanchal Singh Bisht is from a neighbouring village. His cousin, Pushkar Singh, 24, is also stuck in the collapsed tunnel.

Nervous when he first arrived at the site, Chanchal had no idea what to expect. When he was finally able to speak with Pushkar via walkie-talkie, he felt relieved.

"He said, 'I am ok, you can go home. I will come home, I am safe in here, I have what I need in here.'"
