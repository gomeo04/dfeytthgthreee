Woods was one under after 14 holes but double-bogeyed the 15th after his wayward drive found a bush and he sits 18th in the 20-player field at Albany.

"I was rusty, I didn't have my feels," Woods told the Golf Channel.


Americans Brian Harman and Tony Finau are tied for the lead on five under in the limited-field event, with England's Matt Fitzpatrick three shots behind.

European Ryder Cup players Justin Rose and Sepp Straka are on level par with Viktor Hovland a stroke further back.

Woods said on Tuesday that caddying for his son Charlie at a 54-hole tournament earlier in November showed him he was ready to return to competitive golf.

"I'm a little bit sore, that's for sure," Woods added after the round.

"We've got some stuff to do tonight to get ready for tomorrow. And then we head back into the gym and get after it tomorrow, and hopefully post a better number."

Woods had fusion surgery on a bone in his ankle to address post-traumatic arthritis following the 2021 car crash that kept him out of golf for nearly 14 monthsandroid
Chaudhary, 50, has been at the tunnel site for the past 11 days. He is staying with men who know his son and is sleeping in barracks made for the labourers.

Two years ago, he lost his eldest son in a construction accident in Mumbai. He says he cannot face the grief of losing another son.

"I pray to God... please don't take this son away from me. All I want is that my son should be out. This is my prayer. This is my last wish."

A landslide near Silkyara, a remote village at the foothills of the Himalayas, collapsed a portion of the tunnel two weeks ago, trapping the workers. The rescue has been delayed by a drilling machine breaking down.

Chaudhary, who goes by only one name, is one of several family members who have travelled here.

Chanchal Singh Bisht is from a neighbouring village. His cousin, Pushkar Singh, 24, is also stuck in the collapsed tunnel.

Nervous when he first arrived at the site, Chanchal had no idea what to expect. When he was finally able to speak with Pushkar via walkie-talkie, he felt relieved.

"He said, 'I am ok, you can go home. I will come home, I am safe in here, I have what I need in here.'"
